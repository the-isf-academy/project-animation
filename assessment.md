# Assessment

When your project is finished, or as it's in progress if it's helpful, assess your project. Review the [project rubric](http://cs.fablearn.org/projects/0-drawingproject.html) and then decide how your project should score on each criterion. Write a paragraph for each criterion justifying your assessment with evidence from your code, planning document, and commit messages. 

## Criterion A - Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking

**Score: X/8**

*My project demonstrates the following learning claims... Here's why.*

## Criterion C - Reflection on Tech and Society 
**Score: X/8**
